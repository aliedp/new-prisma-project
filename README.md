# REST API Example

This example shows how to implement a **REST API with TypeScript** using [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com/de/) and [Photon.js](https://photonjs.prisma.io/).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:prisma/photonjs.git
```

Install Node dependencies:

```sh
cd photonjs/examples/typescript/rest-express
npm install
```

### 2. Install the Prisma 2 CLI

To run the example, you need the [Prisma 2 CLI](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-2-cli.md):

```sh
npm install -g prisma2
```

### 3. Set up database

For this example, you'll use a simple [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). To set up your database, run:

```sh
prisma2 lift save --name 'init'
prisma2 lift up
```

You can now use the [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to view and edit your data in the `./prisma/dev.db` file that was created when you ran `prisma2 lift up`.

### 4. Generate Photon (type-safe database client)

Run the following command to generate [Photon.js](https://photonjs.prisma.io/):

```sh
prisma2 generate
```

Now you can seed your database using the `seed` script from `package.json`:

```sh
npm run seed
```

### 5. Start the REST API server

```sh
npm run start
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can send the API requests implemented in `index.js`, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/feed`](http://localhost:3000/feed).

### 6. Using the REST API

#### `GET`

- `/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

#### `POST`

- `/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

#### `PUT`

- `/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

#### `DELETE`

- `/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`
